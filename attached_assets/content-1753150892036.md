## LOCATION

Since 1898, the Ferry Building has served as a cultural and transportation hub in the Bay Area, and more recently has become an international culinary destination and home to the city’s most beloved Farmers Market. SHACK15 is proud to be located on the top floor of this historic landmark, overlooking the bay with 51,000 sq ft of panoramic waterfront views for our community to enjoy.

## OUR VALUES

At SHACK15, we rally around the next generation of entrepreneurs. We understand the difficulties of choosing the path of most resistance, and we celebrate the hard work and resilience of the entrepreneurs who try to make the world better than they found it.

**SERVICE:** The first value of SHACK15 is Service. This painting of Robert Koffler Jarvik's 7-artificial heart, the world's first mechanical heart, was painted by Polish artist Agniezka Pilat in tribute to SHACK15's value of _Service_. Displayed by the entrance of our Members' lounge, this painting serves as a reminder for everyone entering to create something of service to the world.
